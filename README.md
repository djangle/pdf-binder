# Curry
Curry is a Python library for dealing with artifact integration (ex. merging two PDF files).

(that's the idea at least)

This began, well is beginning, to be a tool to merge monthly financial statements (2 PDF's with a dynamic number of pages).

Currently working on making the parsing of the documents more dynamic.

## Installation
I need to learn about deployment.

```bash
/dist/curry/curry.exe
```

## Usage
And I need to learn about usage too... "Just Use It".
```python
import curry

curry.foobar('foo') # returns 'foo'
...
```
