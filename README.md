# Curry
Curry is a Python library for dealing with artifact integration (ex. merging two PDF files).

Post implementation of Sage IntAcct, monthly financial statements were exported in a new format and needed to be modified manually before posting to the OSB website. This program is intended to save the OSB approximately 2 hours per month of FTE pay by merging these documents with a program.
