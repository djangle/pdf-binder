# Curry
Curry is a Python library for dealing with artifact integration (ex. merging two PDF files).

(that's the idea at least)

## Installation
An executable file is included in /dist/curry. Copy this file to your computer if you wish to run it locally. (This doesn't work right now because of the way some files are referenced.) 

Maybe I should learn about deployment.

```bash
/dist/curry/curry.exe
```

## Usage
```python
import curry

curry.foobar('foo') # returns 'foo'
...
```

## Contributing
Pull requests are interesting. I'm still learning how to use github properly. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## License
Not sure what license to use yet.
